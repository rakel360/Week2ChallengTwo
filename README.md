# fizzbuzz.py

Write a function named Fizzbuzz that takes two(2) lists  and returns Fizz if the combined length of the lists is divisible by 3,  Buzz if it is divisible by 5, Fizzbuzz if it is divisible by both 5 and 3  or the combined length of the list.

For example:

fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [ ])    # will return “fizz”

fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [1, 2])  # will return “buzz”

fizzbuzz([1, 2, 3], [1]) # will return 4 

# tuple.py

Count vowels in a string, every letter in the english alphabet is either a vowel or consonant, [a, e, i, o, u] is a list of all vowels. The rest are all considered consonants. 

Write a function that takes a string and returns a tuple containing a new string made of all and only the  vowels from the original  string and the number of duplicates in the original string. Only the first instance of the vowel is considered.

For example:

countVowels(‘dahdah’)  # will return (‘a’, 3)

countVowels(‘drink water’) # will return (‘iae’, 1)

# tuple2.py

Same as tuple.py only that it gives the function an argument
